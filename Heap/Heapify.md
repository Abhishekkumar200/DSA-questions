# Heapify

### Problem Statement:
You are given an array 'ARR' of integers having 'N' elements. Your task is to convert the input array into a min-Binary Heap.
A min-Binary heap is a complete binary tree in which the value of each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values of the children of that node.

### Note:

1. Input array follows 0 based indexing.

2. After constructing the min-heap, the Left child of the 'i-th' node should be present at the (2*i + 1)-th index if it exists.

3. After constructing the min-heap, the Right child of the 'i-th' node should be
