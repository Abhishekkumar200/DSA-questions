# N Queens

#### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer `N`. For a given `N` x `N` chessboard, find a way to place `N` **queens** such that no **queen** can attack any other **queen** on the chessboard.
A **queen** can be killed when it lies in the same row, or same column, or the same diagonal of any of the other **queens**. You have to print all such configurations.
